# PP3BP4
Supporting materials for PP3BP4 manuscript
This repo contains related code with the manuscipt of "Calibration and evaluation of machine-learning algorithms for missense variant classification under ACMG/ClinGen recommendations" by Xinming Zhuo†, Xin Bi†‡, Vimla Aggarwal, Jun Liao*

Supplemental Data 1-4 are tables of supporting data mentioned in the manuscript.

Both supplemental script are written in R (R 3.4.4 or newer). Packages dependency included, but were not limited to, ggplot2, psych, RVAideMemoire, coin, reshape2, and rcompanion (supplemental script). 
Supplemental Script 1 performed Statistical analysis and figure plotting for the variants.
Supplemental Script 2 adjust clasification for ClinGen public available variants with different prediction algorithms according to ClinGen PP3/BP4 recommendations.
